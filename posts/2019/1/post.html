            <h2 class="section-heading">Some Basic Info</h2>

            <p>
              I, Saksham Saini, am currently a 3rd year UG CSE student, 20 year old straight male (stating your gender
              is very important in 2020), at VIT University with an okish cgpa pursuing my B.Tech degree and hoping
              to get a decent job/placement in the near future. `Saqsham` was the name I used until 5th grade and
              idk but I kinda like it, hence I use it as a username(easily available) and a pen name as of now.
            </p>

            <p>
              Not really the social kind and only have a handful of good friends on whom I can rely upon.
              I don't judge people usually, nor underestimate anybody, neither differentiate people.
              I usually spend time in the room with my laptop execpt the usual classes and weekly dinner with my
              friends. I love Dota 2 played and have played around 2500 hours on it, I deleted it since I got
              addicted to it and now I rarely play any kind of games.
              I like to eat good stuff and I certainly do hate the mess' food, except Mondays because we have Chicken
              Biriyani weekly on Monday only but still mess' Biriyani `being good` is a hit or miss thing.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Intersts, Hobby etc.</h2>
            <p>I always had a thing for computers but not the hardware stuff, I can talk bout
              the hardware things but not deep enough. My main interest is in WebDev, making webapps and webservers
              with different types of languages, packages and framework with a kind of software developent
              paradigms are a thing to me, and not to mention DevOps which I recently started to like, as in 6-7 months
              back, it was like a love at first sight, first I started reading about simple virtualization and then
              Cloud
              computing and nowadays making a <a href="github.com/saqsham/IaC-golang">
                <font color="red">project</font>
              </a> on the same.
            </p>

            <p>
              Other than the computer stuff I like to read a lot like manga and novels. (Here is my
              <a href="https://www.anilist.co/user/saqsham">
                <font color="green"> Manga list </font>
              </a> and
              <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/saqsham">
                <font color="blue"> Novel list </font>
              </a> ).
              My favourite genre and themes are: Fantasy, History, Non-Fiction, Fiction, Drama, Supernatural, yep pretty
              much it.
              I also enjoy other genre, and is always open to some nice recommendations. Same applies to TV series
              I have watched a lot of Anime and a some good English TV series ( <a
                href="https://www.imdb.com/user/ur108132465/">
                <font color="purple"> Imdb profile </font>
              </a> ).

            </p>

            <p>
              Now time for some music, I usually listen to music for more than 2 hours on an average day.
              Nowadays listenting to Pink Floyd. My favourite genre include Rock, Hard Rock, Slow Rock, Alternative
              Rock, Progressive Rock, (basically all kinds and
              forms of Rock) and Electronic, Synthwave, and relatively Old Jap Pop-Jazz songs.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Future Goals</h2>
            <p>
              Currently I am looking for a Summer Internship in the upcoming Summer break from 1st May
              to 8th July (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/saksham-saini-10669a18b">
                <Font color="yellow"> LinkedIn profile </Font>
              </a>).
              Please do check out my profile and message/mail/call for an interview/coding exam I will be extremely
              glad, I don't have much hope since this is a very new site.
              As I previously mentioned I like WebDev and DevOps and would love to work in the same field in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than that I wish to live a good life with hoping less worries, unlike nowadays a lot of stuff is
              happening like the talks about WW3 and the epidemic in China called Coronavirus, which will make any
              normal human scared as fuck. "Peace Was Never an Option" or so the meme goes.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Some Stuff That I Felt Like Sharing Here</h2>
            <p>
              I was a total noob until my 3rd sem started. Unlike other college-mates who were doing
              coding/programming from their 8th grade, I was a complete begineer but somehow managed
              to survive that competition and I am still learning and tring to improve my skills.
            </p>

            <p>
              The one thing happened to me was finding a group of people(later snakes) by joining (initially nobody
              knew noone except a few, obviously),some group called `VIT Anime Lovers`, there I found some guys who were
              nice, mean, assholes, snakes almost all kinds of people, we chatted a lot and after a few months made our
              own private group with fewer members, as in around 70 but only 20-25 were active only. It's name is
              `VIT Shitposting Group`, the best name MrFinch could come up with. Ultimately made a few friends and
              came to knew about many OP people like Monkey, MrFinch, Comrade, Rnerd, IntreXon, Moonlight,
              Duddia and others. Which made life in VIT less stressful and easier to spend time in boring classes.
            </p>
